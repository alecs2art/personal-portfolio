# personal-portfolio

The basis of this website is to provide a place where people can get a better understanding of me and my work. As of now the webpage is configured into three separate parts. The “About Me” section will contain a brief paragraph or two explaining who I am and what I do, right now there is some placeholder text until the portfolio becomes more fleshed out. The “Work” section will display some of my projects in neat order using flex boxes. Lastly there is the “Contact Me” section where there will be ways for people to get in touch with me.
